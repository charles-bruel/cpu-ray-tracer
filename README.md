# cpu-ray-tracer

This is a cpu ray tracing written in c and assembly. The goal of this project was to get better at assembly, not to create the best or fastest ray tracer. c++ or rust would probably compile to be faster. Some people can write better assembly than compilers, but I certainly can't. This raytracer may also not have entirely correct physically based rendering, but that's not the goal.
